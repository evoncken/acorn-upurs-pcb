# acorn-upurs-pcb

UPURS - Fast serial transfer utilities for the Acorn BBC Micro.

This project contains the KiCad schematic and PCB design for a
trivial UPURS Adapter.

I created this project to learn about KiCad PCB for designing and
manufacturing prototype PCBs.

The printed circuit boards were manufactured by JLCPCB (not affiliated)

## Layout

- kicad/ contains the KiCad schematic and PCB design files
- kicad/gerbers/ contains the Gerber files as sent to manufacturing
- docs/ contains screenshots and images
